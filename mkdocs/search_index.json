Flerchinger\n\n\nJournal: Hydrological Processes (2016) doi: 10.1002/hyp.10845.\n\n\nAbstract: In the western USA, shifts from snow to rain precipitation regimes and increases in western juniper cover in shrub-dominated landscapes can alter surface water input via changes in snowmelt and throughfall. To better understand how shifts in both precipitation and semi-arid vegetation cover alter above-ground hydrological processes, we assessed how rain interception differs between snow and rain surface water input; how western juniper alters snowpack dynamics; and how these above-ground processes differ across western juniper, mountain big sagebrush and low sagebrush plant communities. We collected continuous surface water input with four large lysimeters, interspace and below-canopy snow depth data and conducted periodic snow surveys for two consecutive water years (2013 and 2014). The ratio of interspace to below-canopy surface water input was greater for snow relative to rain events, averaging 79.4% and 54.8%, respectively. The greater surface water input ratio for snow is in part due to increased deposition of redistributed snow under the canopy. We simulated above-ground energy and water fluxes in western juniper, low sagebrush and mountain big sagebrush for two 8-year periods under current and projected mid-21st century warmer temperatures with the Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) model. Juniper compared with low and mountain sagebrush reduced surface water input by an average of 138\u2009mm or 24% of the total site water budget. Conversely, warming temperatures reduced surface water input by only an average of 14\u2009mm across the three vegetation types. The future (warmer) simulations resulted in earlier snow disappearance and surface water input by 51 and 45\u2009days, respectively, across juniper, low sagebrush and mountain sagebrush.

Williams, and T. Nielson\n\n\nJournal: Journal of Hydrology (in prep for re-submission)\n\n\nAbstract: Woody plant cover has increased 10-fold over the last 140+ years in many parts of the semi-arid western USA. Woody plant cover can alter the timing and amount of plant available moisture in the soil and saprolite. To assess spatiotemporal subsurface moisture dynamics over two water years in a snow-dominated western juniper stand we compared moisture dynamics horizontally across a discontinuous canopy, and vertically in soil and saprolite. We monitored soil moisture at 15 and 60 cm and conducted periodic electromagnetic induction and electrical resistivity tomography surveys aimed at sensing moisture changes within the root zone and saprolite. Timing of soil moisture dry down at 15 cm was very similar between the canopy and interspace. Conversely, dry down at 60 cm occurred 22 days earlier in the interspace than in the canopy. After a rain event, interspaces with more shrubs showed greater increases in soil moisture than interspaces with few shrubs. For the few rain events that were large enough to increase soil moisture at 60 cm, increases in moisture occurred almost exclusively below the canopy. Soil water holding capacity from 0 to 150 cm was a primary driver of areas that were associated with the greatest change in distributed electrical conductivity - an indicator of changes in soil moisture - across the growing season. Vegetation was also correlated with a greater seasonal change in electrical conductivity at these depths. The seasonal change in resistivity suggested moisture extraction by juniper well into the saprolite, as deep as 12 m below the surface.  This change in deep subsurface resistivity primarily occurred below medium and large juniper trees. This study suggests how tree roots are both increasing infiltration below their canopy while also extracting moisture at depths of upwards of 12 m. Information from this study can help improve our understanding of juniper resilience to drought and the hydrologic impacts of semi-arid land cover change.\n\n\nThe article can be found here (coming soon!), or if you do not have access, you can download the proofs here (insert link).",

Woody plant cover can alter the timing and amount of plant available moisture in the soil and saprolite. To assess spatiotemporal subsurface moisture dynamics over two water years in a snow-dominated western juniper stand we compared moisture dynamics horizontally across a discontinuous canopy, and vertically in soil and saprolite. We monitored soil moisture at 15 and 60 cm and conducted periodic electromagnetic induction and electrical resistivity tomography surveys aimed at sensing moisture changes within the root zone and saprolite.

Seyfried, and R. Heinse\n\n\nJournal: Ecohydrology (in prep)\n\n\nThe goal of this research is in some ways a response to the \"\nstreamflow paradox\n\" described in the previous page.  Specifically the goal is to understand if differences in climate across pinyon and juniper cover in the Western U.S. impacts the potential for streamflow to increase with pinyon/juniper removal or decrease with pinyon/juniper encroachment.  \n\n\nAbstract: Pinyon-Juniper (PJ) cover has increased up to 10-fold in many parts of the western U.S. in the last 140+ years. Some claim PJ removal will increase streamflow, but this assertion is contested due to several paired-catchment studies revealing no appreciable gain in streamflow after PJ removal.  These paired-catchment studies were predominantly conducted in the southern range of PJ cover, where a large portion of the precipitation occurs in the summer during high evaporative demand. Much of the PJ cover is in the northern and western range of PJ cover, where the majority of the precipitation occurs in the winter. To ascertain if differences in precipitation timing and amount affect the potential for streamflow to increase with PJ removal, we simulated tree and grass cover at a 4 km resolution and daily time step with the Hydrologiska Byr\u00e5ns Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) model. Forcing data included 1981 to 2010 PRISM precipitation and temperature data across the range of PJ cover in the western U.S. We used groundwater recharge as a proxy for the potential for an increase in streamflow. Comparing three previous paired catchment studies and a paired soil moisture plot study with our simulated groundwater recharge revealed good correlation between measured increase in streamflow or groundwater recharge and our simulated increases in groundwater recharge. For sites in the northern and western range of PJ cover where precipitation predominantly occurs in the winter, difference in groundwater recharge between simulated grass and tree cover was 30.5 mm. Conversely, in sites in the southern range where a large portion of precipitation occurs in the summer, simulated difference in tree and grass recharge was 6.7 mm. Our results reveal that only 29.4% sites, compared to an estimated 45% of sites based on the amount precipitation alone, will see an potential meaningful increase in streamflow with PJ removal.\n\n\nThe article is currently being edited and will be submitted in early Fall 2016.",

Wulfhorst, Kerri Vierling, Beth Newingham, Timothy Link, Janet Rachlow\n\n\nJournal: Ecology and Society (accepted)\n\n\nAbstract: According to the U.S. National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), federal action to manipulate habitat for species conservation requires an environmental impact statement, which should integrate natural, physical, economic, and social sciences in planning and decision making. Nonetheless, most impact assessments focus disproportionately on physical or ecological impacts rather than integrating ecological and socioeconomic components. We developed a participatory social-ecological impact assessment (SEIA) that addresses the requirements of NEPA and integrates social and ecological concepts for impact assessments. We cooperated with the Bureau of Land Management in Idaho, USA on a project designed to restore habitat for the Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). We employed questionnaires, workshop dialogue, and participatory mapping exercises with stakeholders to identify potential environmental changes and subsequent impacts expected to result from the removal of western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis). Via questionnaires and workshop dialogue, stakeholders identified 46 environmental changes and associated positive or negative impacts to people and communities in Owyhee County, Idaho. Results of the participatory mapping exercises showed that the spatial distribution of social, economic, and ecological values throughout Owyhee County are highly associated with the two main watersheds, wilderness areas, and the historic town of Silver City. Altogether, the SEIA process revealed that perceptions of project scale varied among participants, highlighting the need for specificity about spatial and temporal scales. Overall, the SEIA generated substantial information concerning potential impacts associated with habitat treatments for Greater Sage-Grouse. The SEIA is transferable to other land management and conservation contexts because it supports holistic understanding and framing of connections between humans and ecosystems. By applying this SEIA framework, land managers and affected people have an opportunity to fulfill NEPA requirements and develop more comprehensive management plans that better reflect the linkages of social-ecological systems.\n\n\nThe article is should soon be available on the Ecology and Society website.",
