            "text": "Snow\n\n\nVegetation affects snow accumulation and snow melt. Differences in snowpack accumulation vary with canopy opening size, with smaller openings resulting in lower accumulation due to adjacent tree canopy interception, and larger openings reducing accumulation due to increased blowing snow (Pomeroy and Goodison 1997). The ratio of tree height to opening size that results in the highest accumulation in the opening has been shown at 5 times in Colorado (Troendle and Charles 1980) and 2 to 3 times in Alberta (Swanson 1988).  L\u00f3pez-Moreno and Latron (2008) observed that for increasing forest density in snow-dominated temperate mountains, there was a decrease in snow accumulation (L\u00f3pez-Moreno and Latron 2008). While these studies were in boreal, pine, and mixed conifer-deciduous forests that are very different from juniper areas, this information still reveals that snow accumulation varies with opening size. Our study at RCEW included plot and tree level measurements of snow measurements.\n\n\nPlot Level Snow Dynamics\n\n\nSimilar to previous studies in woodlands with seasonal snowpack, snowpack builds up in areas with fewer trees compared to areas with more trees. We can see in our plot at RCEW, that the southern portion of the plot with more juniper trees, there is a lower snowpack, compared to the northern portion of the plot with fewer trees but a larger build up snowpack. \n\n\nJuniper cover and snowpack figure\n\n\n\n\nFigure caption:\n vegetation is from a canopy height model derived from LiDAR data. Snowpack is derived from snow surveys on March 14, 2013, which was nine days after peak snowpack (SWE) based on a continuous measurement at the site climate station.  \n\n\nTree Level Snow Dynamics\n\n\nJuniper impact snowpack dynamics at the tree level as well. Trees intercept snow which reduces the amount of snowpack below trees. But what is often ignored is that snows absorb sunlight which is then emitted to the snowpack below the tree which preferentially melts the snow.  In the figure below, we can see that the snowpack below the tree builds up to a similar extent after a snow storm.  But snow melts at a faster rate below the trees than in the interspace.  Indeed, in water year (WY) 2014, we see that the snow is transient below the tree, but persists in the interspace until March. \n\n\nSeasonal snowpack below juniper and in interspace\n\n\n\n\nFigure caption:\n Lines indicate the average snow depth in the interspace (brown) and under the juniper trees (green) for A) water year (WY) 2013 and B) WY 2014. The bold green and brown lines are the average and shaded region outside the bold lines are the maximum and minimum snow depth. The circles are the average snow depth under trees and in the interspace during a snow survey and the error bars are one standard deviation from those snow survey depth measurements. Due to camera failure, no average was plotted for WY 2013 (Niemeyer et al., 2016, Hydrological Processes).\n\n\nAnother interesting impact that trees have on snowpack dynamics is preferential deposition of snow. Although trees do intercept snow, they also form tree wells or depressions in the snow surface at the base of trees. When another snow storm occurs, this allows for snow to be preferentially deposited under the tree. In the figure below, the D_s ratio is the ratio of snow under the three to under the interspace. So a D_s ratio of below 1 means more snow is deposited in the interspace than under the tree, which is what we typically expect. And a greater D_s ratio, means more snow is deposited under the trees compared to the interspace. The x-axis is simple the snow depth increase for each storm in the interspace (D_inter_tree). We see the difference in depth between the tree and interspace (D_inter_tree) gets larger, the more similar the snow deposition between the interspace and under the trees.  \n\n\nSnow deposition figure\n\n\n\n\nFigure caption:\n This figure shows the ratio of snow depth under the tree to interspace (D_s ratio) for each event (y-axis). The x-axis is data is the difference in snow depth between the interspace and under the tree (D_inter-tree) before the snow event. Therefore, as we move right on the x-axis, it representes greater depth of snow in the interspace than under the tree (i.e. a deeper \"tree well\"). The circle size for each point correlates with the depth of snow deposition in the interspace storm (Niemeyer et al., 2016, Hydrological Processes).\n\n\nBelow is a link to a video (click the photo) of a snow storm that occured in October of 2012.

            "text": "Surface Water Input (SWI)\n\n\nWhile interception is the process where trees and other vegetation intercept incoming rain and snow, surface water input (SWI) is the process of rain and snow melt entering the subsurface. While in rain-dominated environments, hydrologist can just consider throughfall - since any rain that passes through the canopy (and eventually through leaf litter or sub-canopy vegetation) will enter the soil. But in snow-dominated environments like much of the western U.S., while snow can pass through the canopy, it may take weeks or months for that snow to melt.  And before the snow melts, some of it can be sublimated to the atmosphere.  As such, we focused on SWI since precipitation occured as rain and snow at our study site.\n\n\nMeasured SWI and Snow Deposition\n\n\nWe measured snow deposition, snow melt, and rain under juniper trees and outside juniper trees. In the figure below we plotted the total SWI and snow depth (D\nS\n) ratio - which is the SWI or snow depth under the trees divided by the SWI or snow depth in the interspace. A ratio greater than 1 means more SWI/snow depth occured under the tree, a ratio less than 1 means a greater SWI/snow depth occured in the interspace.

But in snow-dominated environments like much of the western U.S., while snow can pass through the canopy, it may take weeks or months for that snow to melt.  And before the snow melts, some of it can be sublimated to the atmosphere.  As such, we focused on SWI since precipitation occured as rain and snow at our study site.",

Soil moisture is a key component in water limited systems of the western U.S. (Loik et al. 2004; Schwinning and Sala 2004). \n\n\nSoil Moisture Timing\n\n\nSoil moisture dynamics between under the tree and outside the canopy vary between studies. Young et al. (1984) during two years of collection found that soil moisture below junipers at 7.5 cm depth depleted faster in open area compared to canopy edge, and then halfway along canopy radius, and depleted lastly at the base of the tree. The open area, canopy edge, and halfway along canopy radius all reached wilting point (-1.5 MPa) by early summer, but the tree base did not reach wilting point even into midsummer (-0.5 MPa).  Breshears et al. (1997) observed soil moisture depletion to be the same rate in open areas as under juniper canopies.\n\n\nIn our study at RCEW, soil moisture dry down timing at 15 cm depth was similar in the interspace as under the canopy. The day half the soil moisture dry down had occured was May 22\nnd\n and May 27\nth\n for the canopy and interspace respectively.

Red (orange) arrows indicate the date of the EMI (ERT) surveys (Niemeyer et al., 2017, Journal of Hydrology).\n\n\nDifference in Soil Moisture Dynamics between Juniper Density\n\n\nWhen we did an event by event analysis, we found an intersting difference in soil moisture dynamics between junipers in high density juniper areas and junipers in low density areas. In the figure below, we subtracted the change in soil moisture at 15 cm in the tree and interspace. For larger rain storms (larger than 5.9 mm), in the low density juniper, the interspace soil moisture increased more than under the trees, whereas the opposite was true in high density juniper areas - the soil under the tree increased more than the interspace. The only difference between the low and high density juniper is the interspace in the low density juniper have a higher density of sagebrush. So when there are more sagebrush present in the interspace, more water infiltrates in the interspace when compared to under the junipers.\n\n\n\n\nFigure caption:\n The y-axis is the difference in the change in volumetric water content at 15 cm (\u0394\u03b8\n15\n) between the tree and the interspace measurement at the same tree for the same, single rain event. Paired tree and interspace \u03b8\n15\n measurements are at the same tree. On the x-axis, the data is divided into event precipitaiton tertiles (one-thirds) across all events. For events with values above y = 0, increase in \u03b8\n15\n was greater under the tree. For events with values below y = 0, increase in \u03b8\n15\n was greater in the interspace. Green boxplots indicate high juniper/low sagebrush areas at the site and brown boxplots indicate low juniper/high sagebrush areas at the site.

We used geophysical methods to ascertain if indeed juniper extract water well into the subsurface.\n\n\nSaprolite and Weathered Bedrock\n\n\nIn our subsurface study we needed to first approximate the depth of soil, saprolite and weathered bedrock. Saprolite is fragments of rock mixed with unconsolidated (i.e. loose) material, and weathered bedrock is bedrock that has been broken up due to natural processes.  While soil when saturated can hold up to half it's volume worth of water, saprolite and weathered bedrock are deeper and hold less water.  Nonetheless, scientists have realized that saprolite and weathered bedrock can potentially be important sources of moisture for trees and shrubs, especially in semi-arid environments. \n\n\nIn this figure, we see the depths of soil, saprolite, and bedrock at our study site at RCEW.\n\n\n\nFigure caption:\n This figure shows the subsurface seismic velocity across the vegetation transect. Seismic velocities of 0 to 700 m/sec are soil. This is purple and blue in the plot - the top 1 or 2 meters. We assumed 700 to 2000 m/sec is saprolite, which is green, yellow, and orange. Finally 2000 m/sec and above is weathered bedrock, which is red in the figure.  Most of the subsurface is saprolite, which can store water, but it stores substantialy less than soil (Niemeyer et al. 2017, Journal of Hydrology).\n\n\nIt is difficult to measure moisture in saprolite and weathered bedrock directly, therefore we used innovative geophysical techniques to indirectly measure moisture.  We do this by using electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). ERT shoots electrical signals through the ground and recieves the signals at another location along a transect. Based on how fast the electricity travels, we can have a good idea what the contents are in the subsurface. Here is a conceptual figure of how this works:\n\n \n\n\nOur goal was to understand if juniper or sagebrush extract water at different depths.

But rock does not. So changes in the armount of water in the subsurface can drastically alter the speed the electrical signal travels. We wanted to know from the wet to dry season, where and how deep junipers extract water. We did an ERT measurement in May, after the snowmelt when the approximate maximum amount of water was stored in the subsurface. Then we did an ERT measurement in August when water stored was at the approximate minimum.  Since there is less water in the subsurface, the places where the electrical signal is lower are places where water has decreased. Here is a picture of the May and August ERT surveys. \n\n\n\nFigure caption:\n ERT measurements from May and August across the vegetation transect (Niemeyer et al. 2017, Journal of Hydrology).\n\n\nAt first look, it is difficult to see where the resistivity increased - i.e. where the electrical signal was slower and therefore where there was less water - between May and August.

Reduction in moisture under junipers occurs up to depths of 12 m - well into the saprolite and some unweathered bedrock.

In the Columbia River Basin, for example, 70-75% of streamflow comes from snow melt (Serreze et al. 1999). Furthermore, in the semi-arid West - states like Idaho, Oregon, and Nevada with the majority of the populations residing in large cities \u2013 the populations in the urban centers are rapidly growing and the majority of the area in the state has low population density (Lang et al. 2008). As populations throughout the western U.S. grow and human demand for water increases, more options are explored to increase water yield. Often schemes are devised to increase water delivery to these population centers by removing vegetation in the uplands.\n\n\nOne option that is often presented to increase water yield in semi-arid landscapes is the removal of pinyon and juniper trees. For much of the last century the justification pinyon and juniper removal has not been water yield, but either forage improvement (Dalen and Snyder 1987; Belsky 1996), since grasses and forbs increase drastically with pinyon and juniper removal or enhancement of sage grouse habitat (Knick et al. 2014). However, justification for pinyon and juniper removal has shifted in the last several decades from forage improvement to augmentation of groundwater recharge, increased base flow, and increased overall streamflow (BLM 1993; 1994). Indeed, there is extensive literature supporting that tree removal in forests increases water yield (Bosch and Hewlett 1982; Stednick 1996; Zhang et al. 2001, Huang et al. 2006; Z\u00e9gre et al. 2010; Zou et al. 2014; Qiao et al. 2015). There is also anecdotal evidence from ranchers and land managers that springs dried up when pinyon and juniper trees encroached into an area (Cockle 2013) or where pinyon and juniper removal augmented streamflow (Kuhn et al. 2007). Due to both reduction in forage and perceived reduction in water yield, ranchers and land managers alike across the semi-arid west view pinyon and juniper as a \u201cweed\u201d and call for its removal (Elbert 1994; Swan 1994).  \n\n\nDespite that many toute that pinyon and juniper removal will augment water yield, these assertions are often based on studies in humid forests or anecdotal evidence. Many studies in pinyon and juniper watersheds reveal negligible increase in streamflow (Clary et al. 1974; Baker Jr 1984; Dugas et al. 1998; Baker Jr and Ffolliott 2000; Owens and Moore 2007). In other cases woody plant expansion increased streamflow (Wilcox and Huang 2010) and in another case woody plant die-off decreased streamflow (Guardiola-Claramonte et al. 2011). As a result of this scientific literature, many scientists question whether pinyon and juniper removal actually results in appreciable gain in most landscapes is highly contested (Huxman et al. 2005; Wilcox et al. 2006; Roundy and Vernon 1999; Ffolliott and Gottfried 2012). Looking at the map of precipitation below (map A) this conclusion makes sense, since precipitation is important to predict streamflow. And there doesn't seem to be a difference in precipitation between areas in the southwest where previous pinyon and juniper removal studies occured, and areas in the norhtern Great Basin where anecdotal evidence of streamflow increases after PJ removal.\n\n\n\n\nFigure caption:\n Map of mean annual precipitation in areas with pinyon and juniper tree. The two letters are sites of previous or on-going pinyon or juniper watershed studies  (Niemeyer et al. 2017, Hydrological Processes). \n\n\nWhether woody plant removal actually increases water yield depends on the physical traints of the plants (rooting depth, canoy size, etc.), climate (precipitation amount, seasonality, and intensities), soil type, and geomorphology (Thurow and Hester 1997; Huxman et al. 2005; Wilcox et al. 2006). Many researchers assert that based on previous water yield studies, only sites with more than 450 mm (18 inches) of precipitation will result in increased water yield if pinyon and juniper are removed (Hibbert 1983; Wilcox 2002; Kuhn et al. 2007). Studies that call into question whether pinyon and juniper removal reduces streamflow cite empirical studies in the southwest and southern Great Basin (Belsky 1996; Roundy and Vernon 1999; Ffolliott and Gottfried 2012), where a large portion of the precipitation occurs during summer monsoons. We can see in the figure (map B) below that in the southwest U.S. where these studies occur the monsoon index - the porportion of the precipitation that occurs in the summer - is high. This means much of the precipitation that occurs during the summer will be lost to evaporation or transpiraiotn. Conversly, many pinyon and juniper reside in the norther Great Basin where precipitation predominantly occurs in the winter when evaporative demand is low. Two empirical studies are underway in the northern pinyon and juniper cover range (labeled in the maps below), the South Mountain paired-catchment study in southwestern Idaho by the USDA-ARS in Boise, Idaho and the Porter Canyon Experimental Forest administered by the USDA-ARS in Reno, Nevada in winter-dominated precipitation regimes. These studies could clarify if and where increases in streamflow would occur with PJ removal.\n\n\n\n\nFigure caption:\n Monsoon index in areas with pinyon and juniper trees. The two letters are sites of previous or on-going pinyon or juniper watershed studies (Niemeyer et al. 2017, Hydrological Processes).\n\n\nOn a final point about pinyon and juniper removal, while many ranchers and land managers consider these trees a \u201cweed\u201d and push for the removal, there are many stakeholders in the semi-arid west who hold these trees in high regard and view tree removal plans with skepticism. The Shoshone-Bannock people of southern Idaho view juniper trees as sacred (C. Davis, personal communication). Ranchers have seen pinyon and juniper removal in south eastern Oregon that included cutting down old growth (>150 years) pinyon and juniper trees (Cockle 2013). While some people call for the removal of juniper to improve forage and water yield, others hold pinyon and juniper with high esteem and regard these schemes with skepticism.\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBaker Jr, M.

            "text": "Climate Moderates Potential Streamflow Shifts with Pinyon-Juniper Cover Change\n\n\nThis project was developed in response to the conflict described in the previous page - is there potential for PJ cover change to result in meaningful shifts in streamflow? To answer this question we utilized a well established process-based hydrologic model to simulate evapotranspiration. Evapotransipration is central to understanding how streamflow will potentially shift, since the amount of precipitation, minus ET, results in the water \"left over\" that either recharges groundwater or becomes streamflow. So shifts in ET result in shifts in streamflow. Below is a conceptual model of the hydrologic model we used to simulate ET. \n\n\n\n\nFigure caption:\n Conceptual hydrologicall model based on Hydrologiska Byr\u00e5ns Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) model (Niemeyer et al. 2017, Hydrological Processes).\n\n\nPrecipitation - Evapotranspiration\n\n\nWe simulated the water budget of all pinyon and juniper cover (based on USDA Forest Service (USFS) and US Geological Survey (USGS) 1 km map). Daily temperature and precipitation from 1981 to 2010 was based from PRISM (Daly et al., 1994). We simulated ET in grass and PJ (tree) cover. The central results we are interested in is the difference in ET between tree and grass cover (\u0394ET\ntree\u2010grass\n). Differences in cover was based on differences in soil accessable to roots in the model. For grass, roots could access 100 mm of moisture in the soil (i.e. plant available water). For tree cover, roots could access 200 mm of moisture in the soil. We used the HBV model to simulate shifts in ET (see above figure).\n\n\nWe first evaluated our model by comparing changes in streamflow or groundwater recharge in field studies with our simulations. The Beaver Creek study in Arizona saw a 9-year average increase of 9.7 mm (Clary et al. 1974). In the same grid cell, HBV simulated a 7.6 mm increase in \u0394ET\ntree\u2010grass\n. In Texas, two studies revealed a 2.4 mm and 3.8 mm increase in streamflow after PJ cover removal (Richardson et al. 1979; Wright 1996). In our study the average increase in \u0394ET\ntree\u2010grass\n was 6.9 mm and 3.1 mm in the two corresponding cells, respectively. Finally, at Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, a study where dense sagebrush was removed saw an increase in groundwater recharge of 60 mm (Seyfried and Wilcox 2006). Our model simulated a 64.6 mm increase in \u0394ET\ntree\u2010grass\n in the same grid cell. Taking the comparison of these four field studies and our simulations, we see our study simulated changes in streamflow or groundwater recharge via the ET reasonably well. \n\n\nWe simulated \u0394ET\ntree\u2010grass\n across PJ cover in the western US. Again, \u0394ET\ntree\u2010grass\n is essentially how much streamflow could potentially increase with removal pinyon and juniper trees. The annual average \u0394ET\ntree\u2010grass\n is mapped in the figure below. Gray and yellow areas have little or no difference in ET between grass and PJ cover. Areas in green, blue, and purple have greater increases in ET between tree and grass cover. In the inset figure, areas where ET between grass and PJ cover were statistically different are colored. Converseley, areas in the subset figure in grey are statistically not different. \n\n\n\n\nFigure caption:\n Map of average annual \u0394ET\ntree\u2010grass\n.

In the the southwestern U.S. - Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas - most areas have little or no increase in \u0394ET\ntree\u2010grass\n with changes in cover.

In the figure below, the areas in purple are more sensitive to change in plant availabe water, and are therefore areas where changes in PJ cover is more likely to produce changes in streamflow.

To answer this question we utilized a well established process-based hydrologic model to simulate evapotranspiration. Evapotransipration is central to understanding how streamflow will potentially shift, since the amount of precipitation, minus ET, results in the water \"left over\" that either recharges groundwater or becomes streamflow.

This means that less precipitation will fall as snow, and more as rain. At our juniper site at RCEW, in 20007-2014, 63.3% of precipitation fell as snow, but under future climate projections for 2046-2065, only 37.3% of preciptiation fell as snow. This means that soil will likely get drier earlier in the spring and summer.\n\n\n\nFigure caption:\n The y-axis is the fraction of precipitation falling as snow to total precipitation (P\nG\n) for each month, during 2007-2014 (blue circles) and during mid-21st century warming (red squares). Points are averages over each eight-year period, error bars denote one standard deviation.\n\n\nSnowpack\n\n\nAs precipitation shifts from predominantly snow to predominantly rain, with either increasing juniper encroachment or juniper removal, these co-occuring processes (shifts from snow to rain and shifts to/from sagebrush or to/from juniper) can excacerbate or reduce hydrologic impacts. For example, we simulated current (2007-2014) and future (2046-2065) snowpack in sagebrush and juniper. We see that while a greater amount of snow is deposited in sagebrush under the current climate, due to less precipitation falling as snow, there is almost no difference in snowpack regime between sagebrush and juniper in the future climate.\n\n   \n\n\nFigure caption:\n Plot of average SWE for multiple scenarios.

SWI is the amount of water that enters the soil. ES loss is the amount of water lossed to the atmosphere via evaporation from soil and plant surfaces or transpiration by actively transpiring plants. We can see that under the current climate (2007 - 2014), snow disapepars on average April 14th across all vegetation types. Conversley under the future climate (2046 - 2065) snow disappearance occured on average on February 22nd. This results in SWI occuring 41 to 56 days earlier, depending on the vegetation type. Finally, ES loss increases slightly between the current and future climate, on average 20 mm. However vegetation type exerts a greater contorl on ES loss than climate with differences in SWI between junioper and sagebrush all being greater than 100 mm.       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuniper\n\n\nMtn. sage\n\n\nLow sage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnow disap. day - current\n\n\n103 +/- 21\n\n\n104 +/- 20\n\n\n105 +/- 19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnow disap. day - future\n\n\n47 +/-18\n\n\n52 +/- 21\n\n\n59 +/- 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSWI - current (mm)\n\n\n390 +/- 109\n\n\n511 +/- 121\n\n\n545 +/- 118\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSWI - future (mm)\n\n\n377 +/- 103\n\n\n492 +/- 112\n\n\n535 +/- 116\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSWI 50% - current (days)\n\n\n178 +/- 18\n\n\n183 +/- 18\n\n\n185 +/- 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSWI 50% - future (days)\n\n\n132 +/- 17\n\n\n142 +/- 14\n\n\n137 +/- 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\nES loss - current (mm)\n\n\n213 +/- 16\n\n\n114 +/- 16\n\n\n123 +/- 22\n\n\n\n\n\n\nES loss - future (mm)\n\n\n229 +/- 19\n\n\n138 +/- 10\n\n\n142 +/- 23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable caption:\n SWI amount and timing for current and future climates for the two eight-year periods.

Indeed some exceptionally hot and dry summers have caused pinyon pine die-off in the Southwestern U.S. Studies have shown that these mass die-offs occurred almost exclusively to pinyon pine, but not to juniper. There's varios causes, but one reason could be rooting depth. Studies have shown that juniper species are deeper rooted than pinyon species in the Southwestern U.S. For example, for co-existing \nJ. osteosperma\n (mono juniper) and \nP. edulis\n (pinyon pine), \nJ. osteosperma\n utilized deeper pools of soil moisture and \nP. edulis\n used shallower pools of soil moisture (West et al. 2007). In our studies in Idaho revealed that western juniper can access water up to 12 m in depth (see \nthis page\n for a more detailed description). It is therefore likely that western junipers will be resilient to future summers that are drier and warmer. \n\n\nInformation on this page is based on \nthis publication\n, where you can find  more detailed information about this study.",

More throughfall occurs in the interspace with sagebrush due to greater juniper canopy interception and resulting greater total infiltration in the near surface of the interspace. But due to roots facilitating preferential infiltration below the juniper and sagebrush, deeper infiltration occurs in areas with A) more sagebrush and B) juniper. Infiltration goes deeper in the interspace where there are more sagebrush. Infiltration goes deepest below juniper regardless of where it resides. Juniper also uptake subsurface water at deep in the saprolite (Niemeyer et al. 2017, Journal of Hydrology).  Information on this page is based on  this publication  and  this publication , where you can find more detailed information about this conceptual model and related processes.",

To better understand how shifts in both precipitation and semi-arid vegetation cover alter above-ground hydrological processes, we assessed how rain interception differs between snow and rain surface water input; how western juniper alters snowpack dynamics; and how these above-ground processes differ across western juniper, mountain big sagebrush and low sagebrush plant communities. We collected continuous surface water input with four large lysimeters, interspace and below-canopy snow depth data and conducted periodic snow surveys for two consecutive water years (2013 and 2014). The ratio of interspace to below-canopy surface water input was greater for snow relative to rain events, averaging 79.4% and 54.8%, respectively. The greater surface water input ratio for snow is in part due to increased deposition of redistributed snow under the canopy. We simulated above-ground energy and water fluxes in western juniper, low sagebrush and mountain big sagebrush for two 8-year periods under current and projected mid-21st century warmer temperatures with the Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) model. Juniper compared with low and mountain sagebrush reduced surface water input by an average of 138\u2009mm or 24% of the total site water budget. Conversely, warming temperatures reduced surface water input by only an average of 14\u2009mm across the three vegetation types. The future (warmer) simulations resulted in earlier snow disappearance and surface water input by 51 and 45\u2009days, respectively, across juniper, low sagebrush and mountain sagebrush.

Woody plant cover can alter the timing and amount of plant available moisture in the soil and saprolite. To assess spatiotemporal subsurface moisture dynamics over two water years in a snow-dominated western juniper stand we compared moisture dynamics horizontally across a discontinuous canopy, and vertically in soil and saprolite. We monitored soil moisture at 15 and 60 cm and conducted periodic electromagnetic induction and electrical resistivity tomography surveys aimed at sensing moisture changes within the root zone and saprolite. Timing of soil moisture dry down at 15 cm was very similar between the canopy and interspace. Conversely, dry down at 60 cm occurred 22 days earlier in the interspace than in the canopy. After a rain event, interspaces with more shrubs showed greater increases in soil moisture than interspaces with few shrubs. For the few rain events that were large enough to increase soil moisture at 60 cm, increases in moisture occurred almost exclusively below the canopy. Soil water holding capacity from 0 to 150 cm was a primary driver of areas that were associated with the greatest change in distributed electrical conductivity - an indicator of changes in soil moisture - across the growing season. Vegetation was also correlated with a greater seasonal change in electrical conductivity at these depths. The seasonal change in resistivity suggested moisture extraction by juniper well into the saprolite, as deep as 12 m below the surface.  This change in deep subsurface resistivity primarily occurred below medium and large juniper trees. This study suggests how tree roots are both increasing infiltration below their canopy while also extracting moisture at depths of upwards of 12 m.

Given the importance of streamflow in the western U.S., it is important to understand how shifts in PJ woodland cover may produce changes in streamflow across the region's diverse hydroclimates. To this end, we simulated the land surface water balance with contrasting woodland and grassland cover with the Hydrologiska Byr\u00e5ns Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) model at a 4\u2010km resolution across the distribution of PJ woodlands in the western U.S. We used shifts in evapotranspiration (ET) between woodland and grassland cover as a proxy for potential changes in streamflows. Comparison of HBV model results with paired catchment studies indicated the model reasonably simulated annual decreases in ET with changes from woodland to grassland cover. For the northern and western ecoregions of the PJ distribution in the western U.S. where precipitation predominantly occurs in the winter, HBV simulated a 25 mm (37%) annual decrease in ET with conversion to grassland from woodland. Conversely, in southern ecoregions of PJ distribution with prominent summer monsoons, annual differences in ET were only 6 mm (19%).
