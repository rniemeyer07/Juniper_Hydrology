Precipitation intercepted by the canopy either falls to the leaf litter or soil or evaporates.

A large portion of intercepted precipitation is evaporated to the atmosphere and therefore does not enter the soil profile (Calder, 1998).  Precipitation interception by either the tree canopy or the leaf litter is a major component of the land surface water cycle, consisting of as much as half of the precipitation in some systems (H\u00f6rmann et al., 1996; Carlyle-Moses, 2004). Interception can range from 11 \u2013 36% in deciduous forests and 9 \u2013 48% in conifer forests (H\u00f6rmann et al., 1996).

Differences in snowpack accumulation vary with canopy opening size, with smaller openings resulting in lower accumulation due to adjacent tree canopy interception, and larger openings reducing accumulation due to increased blowing snow (Pomeroy and Goodison, 1997). The ratio of tree height to opening size that results in the highest accumulation has been shown at 5 times in Colorado (Troendle and Charles, 1980) and 2 to 3 times in Alberta (Swanson, 1988).  L\u00f3pez-Moreno and Latron (2008) observed that for increasing forest density in snow-dominated temperate mountains, there was a decrease in snow accumulation (L\u00f3pez-Moreno and Latron, 2008). While these studies were in boreal, pine, and mixed conifer-deciduous forests that are very different from Juniper areas, this information still reveals that snow accumulation varies with opening size. Our study at RCEW ...\n\n\nPlot Level Snow Dynamics\n\n\nSimilar to previous studies in woodlands with seasonal snowpack, snowpack builds up in areas with fewer trees compared to areas with more trees. We can see in our plot at RCEW, that the southern portion of the plot with more juniper trees, there is a lower snowpack, compared to the northern portion of the plot with fewer trees but a larger build up snowpack. \n\n\n\n\nfigure caption: Vegetation is derived from a canopy height model derived from LiDAR data.  Snowpack is derived from snow surveys on March 14, 2013, which was within nine days of peak snowpack (SWE) based on a continuous measurement at the site climate station.  \n\n\nTree Level Snow Dynamics\n\n\nJuniper impact snowpack dynamics at the tree level as well. Trees intercept snow which reduces the amount of snowpack below trees. But what is often ignored is that snows absorb sunlight which is then emitted to the snowpack below the tree which preferentially melts the snow.  In the figure below, we can see that the snowpack below the tree builds up to a similar extent after a snow storm.  But snow melts at a faster rate below the trees than in the interspace.  Indeed, in water year (WY) 2014, we see that the snow is transient below the tree, but persists in the interspace until March. \n\n\n\n\nfigure caption: Average snow depth in interspace (brown) and under tree (green) for A) WY 2013 and B) WY 2014. Bold line is the average and outside border of the shaded region is the maximum and minimum snow depth. Circles are average snow survey snow depth under trees and in the interspace and error bars are one standard deviation. No average was plotted for WY 2013 due to a camera failure and only two stakes for both the interspace and canopy.\n\n\nAnother interesting impact that trees have on snowpack dynamics is preferential deposition of snow. Although trees do intercept snow, they also form tree wells or depressions in the snow surface at the base of trees. When another snow storm occurs, this allows for snow to be preferentially deposited under the tree. In the figure below, a D_s ratio of above 1 means more snow is deposited under the tree than in the interspace. And a greater D_s ratio, means more snow is deposited under the trees compared to the interspace. We see the difference in depth between the tree and interspace (D_inter_tree) gets larger, the more snow is deposited under the tree.  \n\n\n\n\nfigure caption: Ratio of event snow depth under the tree to interspace (DS ratio) across snow events with a range of pre-event differences in snow depth between the interspace and under the tree (Dinter-tree), with increasing values representing greater depth of snow in the interspace than under the tree.

Soil moisture is a key component in water limited systems of the western U.S. (Loik et al., 2004; Schwinning and Sala, 2004). \n\n\nSoil Moisture Timing\n\n\nSoil moisture dynamics between under the tree and outside the canopy vary between studies.  Young et al. (1984) during two years of collection found that soil moisture below junipers at 7.5 cm depth depleted faster in open area compared to canopy edge, and then halfway along canopy radius, and lastly at tree base. The open area, canopy edge, and halfway along canopy radius all reached wilting point (-1.5 MPa) by early summer, but the tree base did not reach wilting point even into midsummer (-0.5 MPa).  Breshears et al. (1997) observed soil moisture depletion to be the same rate in open areas as under juniper canopies.\n\n\nIn our study at RCEW, soil moisture dry down timing at 15 cm depth was similar in the interspace as under the canopy. The day half the soil moisture dry down had occured was May 22nd and May 27th for the canopy and interspace respectively. However, at 60 cm the interspace (brown) dries out sooner than under the tree canopy (green). The day half the 60 cm soil moisture dry down occured in the canopy and interspace was July 14th and June 22nd.   \n\n\n\n\nfigure caption: This figure contains A) snow depth and precipitation pe 990 r day, volumetric water content at 15 cm (\u03b815) and 60 (\u03b860) cm soil depth measured at under the canopy and in the interspace at two trees in the B) low density juniper and C) high density juniper. These \u03b8 data are an average for both trees in each density area. Red (orange) arrows indicate when EMI (ERT) surveys occurred.\n\n\nDifference in Soil Moisture Dynamics between Juniper Density\n\n\nWhen we do a storm by storm analysis, we found an intersting difference in soil moisture dynamics between junipers in high density juniper areas and junipers in low density areas. In the figure below, we subtracted the change in soil moisture at 15 cm in the tree and interspace. For larger rain storms (larger than 5.9 mm), in the low density juniper, the interspace soil moisture increased more than under the trees, whereas the opposite was true in high density juniper areas - the soil under the tree increased more than the interspace.  The only difference between the low and high density juniper is the interspace in the low density juniper have a higher density of sagebrush.  So when there are more sagebrush present in the interspace, more water infiltrates in the interspace when compared to under the junipers.\n\n\n\n\nfigure caption: Difference in the change in volumetric water content at 15 cm (\u0394\u03b815) between tree and interspace after a single rain event. Paired tree and interspace \u03b815 measurements are at the same tree. Tertiles of total event precipitation plotted on the x-axis. For events with values above y = 0, increase in \u03b815 was greater under the tree. Events with values below y = 0, increase in \u03b815 was greater in the interspace. Green (brown) boxplots indicate high juniper/low sagebrush (low juniper/high sagebrush) plot areas, respectively. A non-parametric ANOVA revealed that for precipitation events larger than 1.8 mm, low and high juniper are statistically different.\n\n\nInformation on this page is based on \nthis publication\n, where you can find  more detailed information about this study.",

However, at 60 cm the interspace (brown) dries out sooner than under the tree canopy (green). The day half the 60 cm soil moisture dry down occured in the canopy and interspace was July 14th and June 22nd.      figure caption: This figure contains A) snow depth and precipitation pe 990 r day, volumetric water content at 15 cm (\u03b815) and 60 (\u03b860) cm soil depth measured at under the canopy and in the interspace at two trees in the B) low density juniper and C) high density juniper.

In the figure below, we subtracted the change in soil moisture at 15 cm in the tree and interspace. For larger rain storms (larger than 5.9 mm), in the low density juniper, the interspace soil moisture increased more than under the trees, whereas the opposite was true in high density juniper areas - the soil under the tree increased more than the interspace.  The only difference between the low and high density juniper is the interspace in the low density juniper have a higher density of sagebrush.  So when there are more sagebrush present in the interspace, more water infiltrates in the interspace when compared to under the junipers.   figure caption: Difference in the change in volumetric water content at 15 cm (\u0394\u03b815) between tree and interspace after a single rain event. Paired tree and interspace \u03b815 measurements are at the same tree. Tertiles of total event precipitation plotted on the x-axis. For events with values above y = 0, increase in \u03b815 was greater under the tree. Events with values below y = 0, increase in \u03b815 was greater in the interspace. Green (brown) boxplots indicate high juniper/low sagebrush (low juniper/high sagebrush) plot areas, respectively. A non-parametric ANOVA revealed that for precipitation events larger than 1.8 mm, low and high juniper are statistically different.

            "text": "Streamflow Paradox\n\n\nMost of the water resources in the western U.S. rely on winter snowpack. Water Resources in these regions are at particular risk with climate change due to less snow and more rain (Barnett et al., 2005,  Berghuijs et al. 2014). In the Columbia River Basin, for example, 70-75% of streamflow comes from snow melt (Serreze et al., 1999). Furthermore, in the semi-arid West - states like Idaho, Oregon, and Nevada with the majority of the populations residing in large cities \u2013 the populations in the urban centers are rapidly growing and the majority of the area in the state has low population density (Lang et al., 2008). As populations throughout the western U.S. grow and human demand for water increases, more options are explored to increase water yield. Often schemes are devised to increase water delivery to these population centers by removing vegetation in the uplands.\n\n\nOne option that is often presented to increase water yield in semi-arid landscapes is the removal of pinyon and juniper trees. For much of the last century the justification pinyon and juniper removal has not been water yield, but forage improvement (Dalen and Snyder, 1987; Belsky, 1996), since grasses and forbs increase drastically with pinyon and juniper  removal.  However, justification for pinyon and juniper removal has shifted in the last several decades from forage improvement to augmentation of groundwater recharge, increased base flow, and increased overall streamflow (BLM, 1993, 1994). Indeed, there is extensive literature supporting that tree removal in forests increases water yield (Bosch and Hewlett, 1982; Stednick, 1996; Zhang et al., 2001, Huang et al., 2006; Z\u00e9gre et al., 2010; Zou et al., 2014; Qiao et al., 2015). Indeed there is anecdotal evidence from ranchers and land managers that springs dried up when pinyon and juniper trees encroached into an area (Cockle, 2013) or where pinyon and juniper removal augmented streamflow (Kuhn et al., 2007). Due to both reduction in forage and perceived reduction in water yield, ranchers and land managers alike across the semi-arid west view pinyon and juniper as a \u201cweed\u201d and call for its removal (Elbert, 1994; Swan, 1994).  \n\n\nDespite that many toute that pinyon and juniper removal will augment water yield, these assertions are often based on studies in humid forests or anecdotal evidence. Many studies in pinyon and juniper watersheds reveal negligible increase in streamflow (Clary et al., 1974; Baker Jr, 1984; Dugas et al., 1998; Baker Jr and Ffolliott, 2000; Owens and Moore, 2007). In other cases woody plant expansion increased streamflow (Wilcox and Huang, 2010) and in another case woody plant die-off decreased streamflow (Guardiola-Claramonte et al., 2011). As a result of this scientific literature, many scientists question whether pinyon and juniper removal actually results in appreciable gain in most landscapes is highly contested (Huxman et al., 2005; Wilcox et al., 2006; Roundy and Vernon, 1999; Ffolliott and Gottfried, 2012). \n\n\nWhether woody plant removal actually increases water yield depends on the physical traints of the plants (rooting depth, canoy size, etc.), climate (precipitation amount, seasonality, and intensities), soil type, and geomorphology (Thurow and Hester, 1997; Huxman et al., 2005; Wilcox et al., 2006). Many researchers assert that based on previous water yield studies, only sites with more than 450 mm (18 inches) of precipitation will result in increased water yield if pinyon and juniper are removed (Hibbert, 1983; Wilcox, 2002; Kuhn et al. 2007).  Studies that call into question whether pinyon and juniper removal reduces streamflow cite empirical studies in the southwest and southern Great Basin (Belsky, 1996; Roundy and Vernon, 1999; Ffolliott and Gottfried, 2012), where a large portion of the precipitation occurs during summer monsoons. This means much of the precipitation that occurs during the summer will be lost to evaporation or transpiraiotn. Conversly, many pinyon and juniper reside in the norther Great Basin where precipitation predominantly occurs in the winter when evaporative demand is low. Two empirical studies are underway in the northern pinyon and juniper cover range, the South Mountain paired-catchment study in southwestern Idaho by the USDA-ARS in Boise, Idaho and the Porter Canyon Experimental Forest administered by the USDA-ARS in Reno, Nevada in winter-dominated precipitation regimes. These studies could clarify if and where increases in streamflow would occur with PJ removal.\n\n\nOn a final point about pinyon and juniper removal, while many ranchers and land managers consider these trees a \u201cweed\u201d and push for the removal, there are many stakeholders in the semi-arid west who hold these trees in high regard and view tree removal plans with skepticism. The Shoshone people of southern Idaho view Juniper trees as sacred (C. Davis, personal communication).  Ranchers have seen pinyon and juniper removal in south eastern Oregon that included cutting down old growth (>150 years) pinyon and juniper trees (Cockle, 2013).  While some people call for the removal of Juniper to improve forage and water yield, others hold pinyon and juniper with high esteem and regard these schemes with skepticism",

This means that less precipitation will fall as snow, and more as rain. At our juniper site at RCEW, in 20007-2014, 63.3% of precipitation fell as snow, but under future climate projections for 2046-2065, only 37.3% of preciptiation fell as snow. This means that soil will likely get drier earlier in the spring and summer.\n\n\n\nfigure caption: Fraction of monthly precipitation falling as snow to total monthly precipitation (PG) over WY 2007-2014 (blue circles) and under mid-21st century warming (red squares). Points are averages for the eight-year period, error bars denote one standard deviation.\n\n\nSnowpack\n\n\nAs precipitation shifts from predominantly snow to predominantly rain, with either increasing juniper encroachment or juniper removal, these co-occuring processes (shifts from snow to rain and shifts to/from sagebrush to/from juniper) can excacerbate or reduce hydrologic impacts.  For example, we simulated current (2007-2014) and future (2046-2065) snowpack in sagebrush and juniper. We see that while a greater amount of snow is deposited in sagebrush under the current climate, due to less precipitation falling as snow, there is almost no difference in snowpack regime between sagebrush and juniper in the future climate.\n\n   \n\n\nfigure caption: Average SWE for WY 2007-2014 (solid) and an 8 year period based on the projected climate in 2045-2064 (dotted line).

Panel d) compares average juniper (bold) and mountain big sagebrush (not bold) SWE for current climate (solid) and 8 year period based on 2045-2064 future climate (dotted).\n\n\nSnow Disappearnce, Surface Water Input, and Evapotranspiration Loss\n\n\nTo table below summarize how future warmer temperatures will impact snow, surface water input (SWI), and evapotranspiration (ES) loss. SWI is the amount of water that enters the soil.  ES loss is the amount of water lossed to the atmosphere via evaporation from soil and plant surfaces or transpiration by actively transpiring plants. We can see that under the current climate (2007 - 2014), snow disapepars on average April 14th across all vegetation types.  Conversley under the future climate (2046 - 2065) snow disappearance occured on average on February 22nd. This results in SWI occuring 41 to 56 days earlier, depending on the vegetation type. Finally, ES loss increases slightly between the current and future climate, on average 20 mm. However vegetation type exerts a greater contorl on ES loss than climate.       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuniper\n\n\nMtn. sage\n\n\nLow sage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnow disap. day - current\n\n\n103 +/- 21\n\n\n104 +/- 20\n\n\n105 +/- 19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnow disap. day - future\n\n\n47 +/-18\n\n\n52 +/- 21\n\n\n59 +/- 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSWI - current (mm)\n\n\n390 +/- 109\n\n\n511 +/- 121\n\n\n545 +/- 118\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSWI - future (mm)\n\n\n377 +/- 103\n\n\n492 +/- 112\n\n\n535 +/- 116\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSWI 50% - current (days)\n\n\n178 +/- 18\n\n\n183 +/- 18\n\n\n185 +/- 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSWI 50% - future (days)\n\n\n132 +/- 17\n\n\n142 +/- 14\n\n\n137 +/- 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\nES loss - current (mm)\n\n\n213 +/- 16\n\n\n114 +/- 16\n\n\n123 +/- 22\n\n\n\n\n\n\nES loss - future (mm)\n\n\n229 +/- 19\n\n\n138 +/- 10\n\n\n142 +/- 23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntable caption: SWI amount and timing for current and future climates for the two eight-year periods.

Snow disappearance (disap.) day is calculated based on the first day without snow after February 1st. Evaporation-Sublimation (ES) loss is the average annual loss.\n\n\nJuniper and Climate Change\n\n\nMany climate change studies predict that the summers in the western U.S. will be warmer and drier than historical summers. Indeed some exceptionally hot and dry summers have caused pinyon pine die-off in the southwestern U.S. Studies have shown that these mass die-offs ocured almost exclusively to pinyon pine, but not to juniper. There's varios causes, but on reaseon could be rooting depth. Studies have shown that juniper species are deeper rooted than pinyon species in the southwestern U.S. For example, for co-existing J. osteosperma (mon juniper) and P. edulis (pinyon pine), J. osteosperma utilized deeper pools of soil moisture and P. edulis used shallower pools of soil moisture (West et al., 2007). In our studies in Idaho revealed that western juniper can access water up to 12 m in depth (see \nthis page\n for a more detailed description). It is therefore likely that western junipers will be resilient to future summers that are drier and warmer. \n\n\nSource: Niemeyer et al., 2016, Hydrological Processes",

SWI is the amount of water that enters the soil.  ES loss is the amount of water lossed to the atmosphere via evaporation from soil and plant surfaces or transpiration by actively transpiring plants. We can see that under the current climate (2007 - 2014), snow disapepars on average April 14th across all vegetation types.  Conversley under the future climate (2046 - 2065) snow disappearance occured on average on February 22nd. This results in SWI occuring 41 to 56 days earlier, depending on the vegetation type. Finally, ES loss increases slightly between the current and future climate, on average 20 mm. However vegetation type exerts a greater contorl on ES loss than climate.

Indeed some exceptionally hot and dry summers have caused pinyon pine die-off in the southwestern U.S. Studies have shown that these mass die-offs ocured almost exclusively to pinyon pine, but not to juniper. There's varios causes, but on reaseon could be rooting depth. Studies have shown that juniper species are deeper rooted than pinyon species in the southwestern U.S. For example, for co-existing J. osteosperma (mon juniper) and P. edulis (pinyon pine), J. osteosperma utilized deeper pools of soil moisture and P. edulis used shallower pools of soil moisture (West et al., 2007). In our studies in Idaho revealed that western juniper can access water up to 12 m in depth (see  this page  for a more detailed description). It is therefore likely that western junipers will be resilient to future summers that are drier and warmer.   Source: Niemeyer et al., 2016, Hydrological Processes",

To better understand how shifts in both precipitation and semi-arid vegetation cover alter above-ground hydrological processes, we assessed how rain interception differs between snow and rain surface water input; how western juniper alters snowpack dynamics; and how these above-ground processes differ across western juniper, mountain big sagebrush and low sagebrush plant communities. We collected continuous surface water input with four large lysimeters, interspace and below-canopy snow depth data and conducted periodic snow surveys for two consecutive water years (2013 and 2014). The ratio of interspace to below-canopy surface water input was greater for snow relative to rain events, averaging 79.4% and 54.8%, respectively. The greater surface water input ratio for snow is in part due to increased deposition of redistributed snow under the canopy. We simulated above-ground energy and water fluxes in western juniper, low sagebrush and mountain big sagebrush for two 8-year periods under current and projected mid-21st century warmer temperatures with the Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) model. Juniper compared with low and mountain sagebrush reduced surface water input by an average of 138\u2009mm or 24% of the total site water budget. Conversely, warming temperatures reduced surface water input by only an average of 14\u2009mm across the three vegetation types. The future (warmer) simulations resulted in earlier snow disappearance and surface water input by 51 and 45\u2009days, respectively, across juniper, low sagebrush and mountain sagebrush.

Woody plant cover can alter the timing and amount of plant available moisture in the soil and saprolite. To assess spatiotemporal subsurface moisture dynamics over two water years in a snow-dominated western juniper stand we compared moisture dynamics horizontally across a discontinuous canopy, and vertically in soil and saprolite. We monitored soil moisture at 15 and 60 cm and conducted periodic electromagnetic induction and electrical resistivity tomography surveys aimed at sensing moisture changes within the root zone and saprolite. Timing of soil moisture dry down at 15 cm was very similar between the canopy and interspace. Conversely, dry down at 60 cm occurred 22 days earlier in the interspace than in the canopy. After a rain event, interspaces with more shrubs showed greater increases in soil moisture than interspaces with few shrubs. For the few rain events that were large enough to increase soil moisture at 60 cm, increases in moisture occurred almost exclusively below the canopy. Soil water holding capacity from 0 to 150 cm was a primary driver of areas that were associated with the greatest change in distributed electrical conductivity - an indicator of changes in soil moisture - across the growing season. Vegetation was also correlated with a greater seasonal change in electrical conductivity at these depths. The seasonal change in resistivity suggested moisture extraction by juniper well into the saprolite, as deep as 12 m below the surface.  This change in deep subsurface resistivity primarily occurred below medium and large juniper trees. This study suggests how tree roots are both increasing infiltration below their canopy while also extracting moisture at depths of upwards of 12 m.

At the start of our PhDs in August of 2011, we toured Idaho for a week, visiting with ranchers, federal and state land managers, environmentalists, and a suite of other stakeholders. One of the hydrologic issues that stood out was the question of how does juniper encroachment alter the hydrology of an area. Although my research sought to answer fundamental ecohydroogic questions, increase understanding of social-ecological interactions, etc., this question of how junipers impact water movement in the sagerush steppe was a central question of my dissertation.    Sometimes research went well, and other days it felt like I was just sticking my head in the ground.",

The framework was implemented in the context of a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) 1.5 million acre sage-grouse habitat project in southwestern Idaho. This implemented framework provided a formalized social impact assessment for the project as well as informed managers how to minimize social impacts of their land management actions.
