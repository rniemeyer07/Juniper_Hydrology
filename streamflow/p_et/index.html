                <h1 id="climate-moderates-potential-streamflow-shifts-with-pinyon-juniper-cover-change">Climate Moderates Potential Streamflow Shifts with Pinyon-Juniper Cover Change</h1>
<p>This project was developed in response to the conflict described in the previous page - is there potential for PJ cover change to result in meaningful shifts in streamflow? To answer this question we utilized a well established process-based hydrologic model to simulate precipitation - evapotranspiration (P-ET). P-ET is the water "left over" that either recharges groundwater or becomes streamflow. Below is a conceptual model of the hydrologic model we used to simulate P-ET. </p>
<p><img alt="Conceptual Model" src="../../figures/P_ET.jpg" /></p>
<h3 id="precipitation-evapotranspiration">Precipitation - Evapotranspiration</h3>
<p>We simulated the water budget of all pinyon and juniper cover (based on USDA Forest Service (USFS) and US Geological Survey (USGS) 1 km map). Daily temperature and precipitation from 1981 to 2010 was based from PRISM (Daly et al., 1994). We simulated P-ET in grass and PJ (tree) cover.  Differences in cover was based on differences in soil accessable to roots in the model. For grass, roots could access 100 mm of moisture in the soil (i.e. plant available water). For tree cover, roots could access 200 mm of moisture in the soil.</p>
<p>We first evaluated our model by comparing changes in streamflow or groundwater recharge in field studies with our simulations. The Beaver Creek study in Arizona saw a 9-year average increase of 9.7 mm (Clary et al., 1974). In the same grid cell, our study simulated a 7.6 mm increase in P-ET.  A Texas, two studies revealed a 2.4 mm and 3.8 mm increase in streamflow after PJ cover removal (Richardson et al., 1979 and Wright, 1996). In our study the average increase in P-ET was 6.9 mm and 3.1 mm respectively. Finally, at Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, a study where dense sagebrush was removed saw an increase in groundwater recharge of 60 mm (Seyfried and Wilcox, 2006). Our study revealed a 64.6 mm increase in P-ET in the same grid cell. Taking the comparison of these four field studies and our simulations, we see our study simulated changes in streamflow or groundwater recharge via the P-ET reasonably well. </p>
<p>To estimate gains in streamflow with PJ cover change, we subtracted simulated P-ET in PJ cover from P-ET in grass cover. This is essentially how much streamflow could potentially increase with removal pinyon and juniper trees. The annual average change in P-ET between grass and tree cover is mapped in the figure below. Gray and yellow areas have little or no difference in P-ET between grass and PJ cover. Areas in green, blue, and purple have greater increases in P-ET between grass and PJ cover. In the inset figure, areas where P-ET between grass and PJ cover were statistically different are colored.  Converseley, areas in the subset figure in grey are statistically not different. </p>
<p><img alt="Change in P-ET" src="../../figures/change_P_ET.jpg" /></p>
<p>We see how simulated increases in P-ET vary based on the region. In the the southwestern U.S. - Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas - most areas have little or no increase in P-ET with changes in cover. Conversely, most areas in the norther distribution - California, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Nevada, and Colorado - showed an increase in P-ET with changes in land cover.   </p>
<p>Even though the timing of precipitaiton is important, we wanted to compare if precipitation or monsoon index influenced changes in P-ET. To do this we simulated differences in plant available water in 10 mm across all 30 years. We then graphed how sensitive these areas were across the varios total precipitation and monsoon index.  In the figure below, the areas in purple are more sensitive to change in plant availabe water, and are therefore areas where changes in PJ cover is more likely to produce changes in streamflow.  We see that areas with climates that are both wetter and more mediterranean (i.e. areas where precipitation occurs in the winter) are more sensitive to changes in plant available water.  </p>
